# Project 3
This is group 1's implementation of Project 3 for EECS 448. This project represents a prototype of an image to text OCR reader and translation app. 

## Prototype description
The prototype is an image-to-text OCR reader and translation app that outputs an image file. It works by taking in an image as input, reading the text contained in the image,  and translating said text. It then replaces the source text on the image with the translated version. 

This program is run as a script. To start, a file containing an image will be needed. 

## Getting Started
