Project 1 took 71 hrs
Project 2 took 66.5 hrs
Project 3 took 31.67 hrs
        Using the agile methodology in project 3, we assigned the documentation 3 story points, the input 4 story points and the output 4 story points.
        The estimation for project 3 was 22 hours.
Project 4 Estimation:
        Since, our point values were off for project 3, we assigned the presentation 3 story points, the documentation 5 story points, the test-suite 5 story points, and polishing         of the project 5 story points. In total, the number of story points is 18.
        With each sprint taking 60 minutes and each story point taking 2 sprints, the total time estimation is 18 points x 2 sprint/point x 60 minutes = 2160 minutes, or 36 hours.
