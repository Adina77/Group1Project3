The design paradigm chosen by team 1 was top-down functional decomposition. Top-down functional decomposition is a design paradigm that focuses on breaking down a very large system or project into smaller and much more manageable segments. This allows for each segment to be refined in greater detail and can be done continuously until the entire system is reduced down to a number of modular components that are easy to implement. 

From the top-down level, there is the high-level design of the image to text OCR reader and translation app and its inner workings. The overall goal of this project is to produce a functional text to image translator that can take text from a chosen image and translate it into the user’s preferred choice of language. 
The program can be broken down into several parts. These parts are, the OCR translator file, and the output file. These parts represent individual components that contain the necessary functions to operate and execute the program. 

In the project, the components previously mentioned above were defined through a set of modular, portable, easy to use functions. Examples include functions such as write file, which writes text extracted from the desired image into a new text file, and translate_text, which takes the text from the previously mentioned text file and translates it to the desired language.

To summarize, top-down functional decomposition was chosen as team 1’s design paradigm due to its flexibility, ability to continuously break down and refine components continuously, clarity and system compartmentalization efficiency.
